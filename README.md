Ever want to use US Census data in order to do some data analysis, but the Census website is awful and you wonder how any one uses it.

Here: US Census Bureau statistics in an easy to download .csv file.
Updated whenever I have time in my busy schedule. Hopefully I can get this updated a couple of times a month.
